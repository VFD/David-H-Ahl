## Other repository

I've created a new repository dedicated to the Exelvision computer [Exelvision](https://github.com/VFD/Exelvision).\
The goal is to expand the available software library and gather as much source code as possible.\
Eventually, I aim to develop an experimental AI agent based on this platform.
